Welcome to our real-time canvas game using Socket.io and HTML Canvas! This game is a scalable multiplayer experience where players control circular orbs, aiming to grow in size by consuming smaller orbs while avoiding larger ones. Compete against other players in a dynamic, ever-evolving world.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and playing the game, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the game on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## How to Play

**Objective**: Grow your orb as large as possible by eating orbs (represented as smaller circles) and orbs from other players.

**Controls**: Use your mouse to control the direction of your orb. Your orb will follow your cursor.

**Game Area**: You are in a shared canvas with other players. Be cautious; larger orbs can consume you.

**Scoring**: Your score is based on the size of your orb and the orbs you consume.

**Leaderboard**: Check the leaderboard on the screen to see how you rank compared to other players.

## Game Mechanics

- Orbs will spawn randomly on the canvas.
- Larger orbs can consume smaller orbs.
- When your orb consumes another orb, it will grow in size.
- Avoid contact with orbs larger than yours, as they can consume you.
- Play strategically to reach the top of the leaderboard.
